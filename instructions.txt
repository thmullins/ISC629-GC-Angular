Homework:
Create a Google Cloud account
	https://cloud.google.com

Workshop:

We will be making changes to pre-written files during the Workshop.

The final versions of these files are in the Team Drive
Team Drive-> AngularJS & Google Cloud-> app.yaml and index.html

create an app
	appengine.google.com

	activate cloud shell

set up configuration and Go Application files
In cloud shell
	$ git clone https://github.com/thmullins/ISC629-GC-Angular.git
	check for saved files with >ls
	$ cd ISC629-GC-Angular/

launch code editor to view source code

In cloud shell
	you may check the app locally with
	$ go run *.go
	click web preview-> preview on port 8080
	
	Deploy app
	$ gcloud app create
		your application should have already been created
		if so, this will throw an error
	$ gcloud app deploy --project <project name>
		<project name> is the unique name displayed in yellow on the cloud shell
		when asked to continue, enter yes
	$ gcloud app browse
		follow link to view app
		should be <projectname>.appspot.com

		if you do not see any changes in the browser, it is probably loading the page from cache
